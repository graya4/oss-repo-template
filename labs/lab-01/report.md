## Reading Assignments

- Chapter 3 of 'Free Culture' - 
This chapter was extremely interesting and something that I had actually known about far before I had taken this class. I didn't know that somebody from RPI had ended up in the crossfire of the RIAA, though! Music copyright on the Internet back then (and even now to some extent) was in a very weird position back then. There really wasn't any proper precedent for what counted as copyright infringement or not, so companies like the RIAA would just sue for ridiculous amounts to "send a message" or "set an example". Along with that, there really wasn’t a proper source for listening to music online other than buying a CD. If the CD didn’t exist anymore or was inaccessible, that was the end of it. Even back then, shows like South Park and artists like Weird Al Yankovic lampooned the insane and draconian punishments that the RIAA would give to people who would download a song for a project or would unknowingly have music files on a search engine in Jesse's case. Obviously Jesse isn't a pirate because a project that he was working on had some music files on there, that's ridiculous. Fortunately, the RIAA doesn’t sue random people for 15 million dollars for having a couple files on their search engine. Along with this, finding music to listen to is easier than ever thanks to websites such as Youtube and Spotify. Unfortunately however, the RIAA still takes down open-source archiving projects such as youtube-dl for copyright violations.

## Linux Proof
I dualboot Win 10 and Manjaro Linux (also there was so much that the screenshot couldnt get it all)

## Reflection
1. An Open Source project that I've been interested for a long time on would be https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds/. I've been using the mobile app as a wallpaper since 2013 and it's interesting to see it now that I understand some code.
2. A project that would interest me would be an Android port of the updated version of this wallpaper that was made around 2016. https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS. The old app hasn't been touched in almost 10 years and this version adds multiple layer switching as well as some backgrounds from the game that weren't in the inital app. I also have some ideas of my own that I would wish to implement. Another project that I would be interested in maintaining would be https://github.com/RickDB/PlexMALSync. The API for MAL was drastically changed and made public in 2020 after a security error in 2018 and the app hasn't been updated since then. I actively use Plex on a daily basis and it would be a cool undertaking to update the MAL sync to be more in line with his other project, https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync.
