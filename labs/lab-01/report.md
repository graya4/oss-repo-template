## Reflection
1. An Open Source project that I've been interested for a long time on would be https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds/. I've been using the mobile app as a wallpaper since 2013 and it's interesting to see it now that I understand some code.
2. A project that would interest me would be an Android port of the updated version of this wallpaper that was made around 2016. https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS. The old app hasn't been touched in almost 10 years and this version adds multiple layer switching as well as some backgrounds from the game that weren't in the inital app. I also have some ideas of my own that I would wish to implement. Another project that I would be interested in maintaining would be https://github.com/RickDB/PlexMALSync. The API for MAL was drastically changed and made public in 2020 after a security error in 2018 and the app hasn't been updated since then. I actively use Plex for daily watchings and it would be a cool undertaking to update the MAL sync to be more in line with his other project, https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync.
