## Part 3
It is important to use a license in your projects because it helps establish legal boundaries for what people are allowed to do and what they are NOT allowed to do. Putting a license on your project also allows other people who wish to use your project to actually use it in the first place. If you do not have a proper license on your project, they could legally be at risk for using code from your project. 

## Part 4
You're playing a dangerous game by using projects that don't have a license. Without a license to properly establish what you can and can't do with the project's code, you could be facing a lot of legal trouble that wouldn't be worth what you'd have to do to modify the project. 

## Part 5
I agree that Gopher's main downfall comes from them trying to make developers pay for a licensing fee. For open source software especially, if there is an open source product that fails to meet the standards of their audience, it is inevitable that people will fork that project and make one that satisfies everybody.

Android - Android uses the Apache License 2.0 so then anybody could develop apps and software for it. Its kernel is GPLv2 so that other developers could make their own Android OS if they want to.

Linux - Linux is GPLv2 for the same reason that Android's kernels are GPLv2. It allows people to make their own LInux distros if they want to.

Microsoft - Microsoft's .NET core uses the MIT license to allow people to modify programs that use the .NET core freely. 

SailfishOS - SailfishOS is closed source in order to have it be as secure as possible.
